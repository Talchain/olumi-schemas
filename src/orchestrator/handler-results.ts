// (verified at the bytes on `staging`, 2026-09-11). Quoted verbatim rather than
// paraphrased away:
//
//   "⚠ R-004 (feedback): the fact records `comment_present`, NEVER the comment
//    text — the user's free text may contain PII and a fact row is long-lived
//    and widely read. The contract's `FeedbackResultSchema` is `.strict()`, so
//    a future `comment` field is a deliberate reviewed widening, not a quiet
//    leak."
//
// PAUL SLEE RULED ON 2026-09-11 THAT A USER'S STATED REASONING MAY BE
// PERSISTED. `statement` below IS the deliberate reviewed widening R-004
// anticipated, taken on exactly the axis R-004 named and by exactly the
// mechanism it prescribed — a reviewed change to a `.strict()` schema, not a
// field that slipped in.
//
// ⚠⚠ THE LIMIT OF THAT RULING, STATED BECAUSE A PERMISSION FOUND WITHOUT ITS
// SCOPE GETS GENERALISED. It authorises persisting A USER'S OWN STATED
// REASONING ABOUT A FINDING. It is NOT a general licence to persist free text.
// Specifically:
//   · R-004 is NOT reversed. It still governs `feedback`, whose `comment` stays
//     a rating aside recorded as `comment_present` only. That schema is
//     unchanged by this release and its "REJECTS a verbatim comment field"
//     guard in tests/orchestrator/handler-fact-0.34.test.ts still passes.
//   · The PII half of R-004 still stands in full. This text MAY contain PII.
//     Consumers persist it as authored user content and MUST NOT re-emit it
//     into telemetry, analytics, logs or error payloads. Persisting is
//     authorised; re-emitting is not, and the two are different acts.
//   · It licenses no OTHER free-text field. A future member wanting one needs
//     its own ruling, recorded the same way.
//
// WHY THIS RESULT DIFFERS FROM `FeedbackResultSchema`, which deliberately
// carries only `comment_present: boolean`. The difference is not a relaxation
// of the same rule; it is a different artefact:
//   · `feedback.comment` is an ASIDE ATTACHED TO A RATING. The fact's job is to
//     record the rating; the words are optional colour, and discarding them
//     loses nothing the fact exists to keep. Recording presence is therefore
//     the complete answer, and storing the text would be gratuitous retention.
//   · A dissent's words ARE THE ARTEFACT. `dissent_present: true` records that
//     a human disagreed and destroys WHY — which is the entire content. Olumi
//     is a living shared model of the team's REASONING with humans as the
//     authors; a dissent stripped of its reason is exactly the thing this
//     member exists to stop being lost. There is no smaller shape that carries
//     the meaning, so the retention is necessary rather than incidental.
// Put plainly: for `feedback`, storing the text would add nothing the fact
// needs; for `finding_dissent`, NOT storing it would leave the fact empty.
