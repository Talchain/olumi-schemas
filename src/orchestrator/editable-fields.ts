/**
 * THE CLASSED FIELD-PARITY TABLE — ROADMAP 2.474, design-review amendment A6.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS. The single, derivable source of truth for which graph fields the
 * conversational AI may edit, and in WHICH CLASS. It replaces two hand-maintained
 * mirrors that had drifted apart:
 *
 *   - CEE `src/orchestrator-v5/graph-management/field-safety.ts` —
 *     `ALLOWED_NODE_FIELD_ROOTS` (14 roots), `ALLOWED_EDGE_FIELD_ROOTS` (4),
 *     `ALLOWED_OBSERVED_SUBKEYS` (4), `PIPELINE_OWNED_ROOTS` (8). Self-described
 *     as "reconciled to the sanctioned edit vocabulary" — i.e. a mirror.
 *   - UI `src/canvas/ui/inspector-v2/useInspectorMutations.ts` —
 *     `NODE_SETTER_FIELDS` (21 setters) + `EDGE_SETTER_FIELDS` (5 setters).
 *
 * WHY IT IS *CLASSED* AND NOT A FLAT ALLOWLIST. The "14 vs 26 setters" gap does
 * NOT decompose into "fields the AI is missing". It decomposes into four kinds,
 * and naive parity would be a shipped defect in two of them:
 *
 *   `grant`             the AI should simply hold this field. 22 rows.
 *   `invariant_coupled` the field belongs to a set that MUST move together. A raw
 *                       grant here recreates a desync no validator re-checks — the
 *                       goal_threshold quad has "exactly one sanctioned writer
 *                       (add_constraint's goal-join, which keeps raw/unit/cap/
 *                       normalised consistent)" (field-safety.ts:74-79). Parity is
 *                       owed at the OPERATION level, in a later leg of this train.
 *   `provenance_owned`  parity is DENIED, permanently. "Relabelling an AI-invented
 *                       value as user-extracted is a provenance integrity breach"
 *                       (field-safety.ts:158-161). The 2.474 constraint is
 *                       "AI <= human", and <= is satisfied by <.
 *   `ai_only`           the AI holds it and NO human setter reaches it. Recorded
 *                       rather than normalised: the asymmetry runs both ways and
 *                       hiding that was how the "14 vs 23" framing got minted.
 *
 * VOCABULARY. Rows are keyed on the WIRE field path — the thing the referee
 * actually screens. `adapters/edit-graph-producer.ts:88-141` projects an
 * `update_node` PatchOperation by iterating its `value` KEYS, one envelope per
 * key, so *a PatchOperation update value's keys ARE this vocabulary*. The UI's
 * client spellings (`observedState`, `weight`, `beliefExists`, `strengthStd`)
 * differ, so each row states its own mapping in `ui_client_fields` — the bridge
 * is IN the table, where it is reviewable, rather than in a second hidden mirror.
 *
 * HOW THE TWO CONSUMERS BIND (A6):
 *   CEE  — derives its allowlist from `aiEditableFieldRoots` / `aiEditableObservedSubkeys`.
 *   UI   — asserts every `useInspectorMutations` setter appears in `editableFieldUiSetters()`.
 *   BOTH — call `requireEditableFieldTableRevision(n)` at boot so a repo on an
 *          older `@talchain/schemas` pin fails LOUD instead of silently using a
 *          shorter table (hazard 1: a consumer on an older pin silently drops
 *          what it does not know).
 *
 * AND THE HALF DERIVATION CANNOT PROVIDE (trap 12d, measured 4 Aug 2026): a
 * derived guard proves the copies AGREE and is structurally BLIND to this table
 * being SHORT. `tests/orchestrator/editable-fields.test.ts` therefore also ships
 * a HAND-WRITTEN corpus that spells the real field and setter names out. Both
 * guards ship; neither supersedes the other.
 *
 * ── REVISION 2 (5 Aug 2026) — THE RIGHT-HAND PANEL LEG (2.474) ───────────────
 * The panel enumeration REFUTED the design brief's premise. The brief said "the
 * panel is currently OUTSIDE the mutation contract entirely"; measured at UI
 * staging `0ac79113`, the panel's editors REUSE `useInspectorMutations`, so the
 * right-hand panel introduces ZERO new AI-editable field vocabulary — it is a
 * second SURFACE over the SAME vocabulary. No new op kinds were owed, and
 * `edit-tool-ops.ts`'s union stays pinned to the six graph kinds. Revision 2
 * therefore adds exactly ONE row (`edge.validation`) and corrects two write-site
 * claims; it does not widen what the AI may touch by a single field.
 *
 * ── A4 IS NOT BLOCKING FOR THE PANEL (recorded so the staleness lane need not
 *    re-derive it) ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Amendment A4 asks Paul to extend the D-S freshness relaxation to STRUCTURAL
 * candidates, because `frame-gate.ts:41` trusts only `{fresh, none}` and the
 * relaxation at `:43-47` is tunable-only — so after any applied edit on an
 * analysed scenario, structural proposals return governing `stale`. That gate is
 * real and still unbuilt. It does NOT block the panel leg: the enumeration found
 * NO reachable structural operation anywhere in the right-hand panel (the one
 * candidate, the Status-Quo-baseline action, was measured unreachable and has
 * been deleted — UI PR #597). Every reachable panel edit is a VALUE edit, i.e.
 * TUNABLE-class, and therefore already inherits the D-S relaxation. Note the
 * limit bites the HUMAN path too, independently of CEE: `ResultsBody.tsx:144-146`
 * nulls the panel's own factor writers whenever `isStale || isRunning`.
 *
 * Derived at: UI staging 0ac79113bafe089ad0b533a92c0470248cebb29f,
 *             CEE staging e82738b20ca83fadfb1e8404af7e84380d9a59bd (5 Aug 2026).
 * (Revision 1 was derived at UI dae8908f / CEE ac62fd4d.)

An AI writing `resolved_by: \'user\'` asserts that a human adjudicated when none did — the same integrity breach as observed_state.source, one level up (it launders consent, not just a value). CEE ALREADY denies it (`validation` sits in CEE_ANALYSIS_OWNED_ROOTS, field-safety.ts:173, unioned into PIPELINE_OWNED_ROOTS at :216-218), so this row changes NO behaviour at any consumer — the union is identical. What it changes is the RECORD: `provenanceOwnedSegments()`\'s own doc said CEE owns `validation` et al. because they "have no human setter and therefore no row here", and that premise is false at UI staging 0ac79113 — three human write sites, listed above. The verdict was right and its stated reason was wrong, which is precisely the shape that rots: the next lane to re-derive this table from "fields with human setters" would have found a setter, believed the field had been overlooked, and granted it. Also note what this row does NOT do: it screens the `validation` SEGMENT, so an AI update naming it now gets the precise provenance reason instead of the generic FIELD_NOT_ALLOWED, and an add payload carrying it nested is caught by the smuggle guard.',

 * owned set from this function must take the UNION with whatever it already
 * denies — `CEE_OWNED = PIPELINE_OWNED_ROOTS ∪ provenanceOwnedSegments()`. It
 * may WIDEN; it may NEVER NARROW. The two sets are not equal and are not meant
 * to be: this table adds `threshold_source` (J2) which CEE does not yet own,
 * while CEE owns analysis-derived stamps (`defaulted`, `origin`,
 * `provenance_display`) that no human setter reaches and which therefore have no
 * row here. A consumer that INTERSECTED, or that replaced its list with this
 * one, would silently un-deny every stamp this table does not happen to name — a
 * provenance breach introduced by an operation that reads like a tidy-up.
 *
 * ⚠ CORRECTED 5 Aug 2026 (2.474 panel leg) — THIS PARAGRAPH NAMED `validation`
 * IN THAT LIST AND THE STATED REASON WAS FALSE. It read "…(`validation`,
 * `defaulted`, `origin`, `provenance_display`) that have no human setter and
 * therefore no row here." Measured at UI staging `0ac79113`, `validation` HAS
 * three human write sites — the right-hand panel's contested-edge resolution
 * (`ModelTabBody.tsx:638,:662,:670`) writes `user_action`, `resolved_by: 'user'`
 * and `resolved_value`. The VERDICT was right (CEE owns it, the AI must never
 * write it) and the REASON was wrong, which is the shape that rots: a later lane
 * re-deriving this table from "fields a human setter reaches" would have found
 * the setter, concluded the field had been overlooked, and GRANTED it. So
 * `validation` now has an explicit `provenance_owned` row and has left this
 * sentence. The remaining three are named on the narrower, checked claim that no
 * human setter reaches them — if you are about to add one, add a row instead of
 * editing this list. A denial resting on a false premise is one honest re-derivation
 * away from becoming a grant.
 *
 * The same direction applies to the allowlist accessors, inverted: those are
 * the maximum the AI may touch, and a consumer may narrow but never widen them.
