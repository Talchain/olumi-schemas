// 0.56.0 — ANALYSIS PARTICIPATION: WHAT THE RUN WAS NOT ALLOWED TO SEE
//
// A user can mark a node as kept out of the calculation
// (`node.analysis_participation === 'retained_excluded'`, CEE's participation
// guard). The node is withheld from the graph CEE hands PLoT, and so is every
// edge incident to it — PLoT's `/v2/run` preflight rejects a dangling endpoint,
// so the edges cannot stay. The analysis then runs on a REDUCED MODEL, and
// every number in the result is internally consistent with a graph the user is
// not looking at, so they cannot detect it by reading carefully.
//
// ⭐ THIS EXISTS BECAUSE THE ONLY EXISTING CHANNEL WAS PROSE. CEE #1602 shipped
// a user-facing sentence carrying both counts and exported its GRAMMAR (a
// regex) as the machine-readable binding. The UI lane refused that binding, and
// the argument is the reason this field exists:
//
//     "A regex binding fails silently and open. If you change the sentence, my
//      match returns nothing, the disclosure vanishes from my surface, and
//      nothing goes red anywhere. So the failure mode of the binding is
//      identical to the failure mode it is meant to close."
//
// It is also a hand-maintained mirror (this estate's dominant defect): the
// constant is exported from CEE, which the UI does not consume, so a consumer
// binding to the grammar would be COPYING it. The sentence stays — it is what
// reaches the user — but a consumer now reads integers.
//
// ⛔ TWO COUNTS, NAMED APART, NEVER COLLAPSED INTO A TOTAL. They answer
// different questions and have different remedies:
//   `excluded_node_count` — parts of the model the USER marked. The user did
//       this, knows they did it, and can undo it node by node.
//   `pruned_edge_count`   — connections dropped as a CONSEQUENCE of those
//       marks. The user did NOT mark these and may not know they are gone; a
//       single excluded factor can take several connections with it.
// A sum would say "5 things were removed" and destroy exactly the distinction
// that makes the second number worth telling anyone (CLAUDE.md trap 21).
//
// ⛔ NO CROSS-FIELD REFINEMENT, DELIBERATELY. CEE's guard cannot produce
// `pruned_edge_count > 0` with `excluded_node_count === 0`, and this schema
// does NOT encode that. It is CEE doctrine about how the guard walks the graph;
// copying it here would create a rule that must change in two repos at once and
// would reject counts a legitimately-newer CEE emits. The contract owns the
// SHAPE; the meaning stays with the guard — the same reasoning
// `ConstraintVerdictSchema` records for `may_name_leading_option`.
//
// Counts are non-negative because ZERO IS A LEGITIMATE VALUE HERE, unlike
// `ModelBuildingNoticesSchema` above: a present carrier with `{0, 0}` is the
// positive attestation "the guard ran on this analysis and withheld nothing",
// which is a real and useful claim. That is what makes absence mean something
