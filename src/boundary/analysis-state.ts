// ============================================================================
// 0.46.0 — AnalysisStateV1: ONE composed analysis-state verdict.
//
// Analysis-state authority migration, STEP 2 (contract only). CEE emits ONE
// `analysis_state` per turn on the turn envelope, beside `analysis_ready`
// (OlumiResponseSchema.analysis_state). It is intended to become the SINGLE
// wire authority every surface consumes for "what is the state of the
// analysis, and what may I say about it".
//
// THE DEFECT CLASS THIS EXISTS TO CLOSE. Today each surface derives its own
// answer to that question from a different subset of the payload — a status
// string here, a freshness comparison there, an entitlement flag somewhere
// else — and the derivations disagree. Trap 21 in the estate's doctrine is
// exactly this shape measured in production: two authorities answering
// DIFFERENT questions under SIMILAR names, so a confirmation withheld a
// leader while the coaching sentence beneath it named one. A composed verdict
// computed ONCE by the producer is the structural fix: every surface reads the
// same fields, so two surfaces CANNOT disagree about a fact neither of them
// derives.
//
// WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT HERE, and why:
//   * NO consumer-derivable convenience. `requires_rerun` and friends are
//     producer-computed because a consumer recomputing them re-opens the
//     divergence this shape exists to close (the RunDelta S3 precedent: the
//     UI renders with ZERO client-side computation).
//   * NO cross-field refinement. Every composition rule below is stated as
//     LICENCE in a `.describe()` and is NOT enforced by the parser — see
//     "DISCLOSED LIMITS" at the foot of this header. Encoding a rule whose
//     producer does not yet exist would be this package guessing CEE's
//     semantics, which is trap 13c (a perfect score against a wrong oracle).
//     The gaps are named and pinned by tests rather than left for a reader to
//     assume closed — the AnalysisFactSchema 0.27.0 precedent.
//   * NO closed vocabulary for `reason_code`, `category`, `repairability`,
//     `readiness.status`, `aggregate_level` or `separation`. Those vocabularies
//     live with the producer (CEE), and a closed enum here would be a
//     hand-maintained mirror of a registry this package does not own — the
//     `metric_id` / `reason_code` rationale from analysis-fact.ts, applied
//     identically. Where the ratified design DID close a vocabulary
//     (`run_state.kind`, the two `cause` axes) it is closed here.
//
// THE DATA-VS-DESIGNATION DOCTRINE, because it is the reason `leader_claim`
// is a separate member rather than a boolean beside the numbers: withholding
// a leader claim drops the DESIGNATION ("Option B leads") and keeps the DATA
// (the win probabilities). A consumer that hides the probabilities when the
// designation is withheld has over-applied the rule; a consumer that names a
// leader from the probabilities when it is withheld has defeated it.
//
// DISCLOSED LIMITS (stated, not assumed closed):
//   L1. `leader_claim.permitted: true` alongside `withheld_reason` PARSES.
//       The two are contradictory in meaning and the parser does not refuse
//       the contradiction, because this package cannot yet derive from a
//       producer whether the pair is genuinely unreachable.
//   L2. NARROWED IN 0.47.0 — the usability booleans are now PARTIALLY
//       cross-checked against `run_state`, enforcing exactly the pairs a
//       producer-side derivation (CEE `c5e24307`, ROADMAP 2.1259) proved
//       unreachable — see `refineAnalysisStateV1` below for the six rules and
//       the per-rule proof class. WHAT REMAINS OPEN, deliberately:
//         * `blocked_unusable` under `never_run` / `unknown_degraded` /
//           `refused` / `running` PARSES — the first two are the coherent
//           future encoding of CEE's `scenario_claims_analysis_no_fact`
//           contradiction, refusal pairing is CEE policy (its freshness clamp
//           retires at migration step 6), and `running` has no producer yet;
//         * `usable_for_chips` under `unknown_degraded` PARSES — reachable
//           (a hash-proven fresh verdict whose fact carries a non-UTC
//           `computed_at` string degrades the kind, not the chip predicate);
//         * NO positive is forced (e.g. `complete_stale` does not require
//           `requires_rerun: true`) — the producer's predicates may
//           legitimately tighten, and a forced positive would refuse the
//           tightened emission (L3 keeps contradiction semantics open).
//   L3. `contradictions` is the producer's OWN self-report of disagreements it
//       detected while composing this verdict. An empty array asserts the
//       producer found none — it is NOT evidence that none exist.
//   Each limit is pinned by a named test in
//   `tests/boundary/analysis-state-0.46.test.ts`, so it is visible in the
//   suite rather than invisible to it. They are the first questions for the
//   one-shot external adjudication this contract is earmarked for.

 * wire projection: `compose/analysis-state-v1.ts` composeRunState — both read
 * ONE canonical object, which is what makes the rules below theorems rather
 * than conventions). Proof classes:
 *   STRUCTURAL — follows from the producer's own predicate definitions for any
 *     input whatsoever (e.g. the same `status === 'blocked'` that selects the
 *     blocked run-state branch forces `blockedUnusable` in the same object).
 *   PRODUCER-DOMAIN — follows from the output domain of every freshness
 *     derivation in the producer (e.g. a `fresh` verdict always carries a
 *     selected fact, so the no-fact contradiction cannot co-occur with it).
 *
 *   CC-A [structural]      kind 'blocked' ⇒ blocked_unusable MUST be true.
 *   CC-B [producer-domain] kind 'complete_current' | 'complete_stale' ⇒

 *   CC-C [structural for prose/chips; producer-domain for followup/rerun]

 *                          usable_for_chips / usable_for_followup MUST be

 *                          requires_rerun beside blocked_unusable — reachable.
 *   CC-E [structural]      usable_for_chips ⇒ requires_rerun MUST be false
 *                          (chips require fresh + no trust downgrade; rerun
 *                          requires stale or a trust downgrade).
