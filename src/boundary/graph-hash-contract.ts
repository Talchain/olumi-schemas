// ============================================================================
// Canonical graph-hash CONTRACT (0.22.0 — S1, ROADMAP 1.179/1.181).
//
// This module carries the CONTRACT DOCUMENTATION for the graph-identity
// handshake — the ONE canonical keep-list every producer of a `graph_hash`
// (OlumiResponseSchema, olumi-response.ts) or `computed_against_hash`
// (AnalysisResultBlockSchema, blocks.ts) MUST hash, and the `GRAPH_DIVERGED`
// error code (error-codes.ts) a consumer raises on mismatch.
//
// ⚠ THE IMPLEMENTATION LIVES CEE-SIDE, DELIBERATELY. This module does NOT
// implement a hashing function. The live runtime hash is CEE's
// `computeAnalysisAffectingGraphHash` (`graph-hash.ts`), verified this session
// to hash nodes + edges + options(sorted by id) + goal_node_id +
// goal_constraints. Shipping a SECOND hashing implementation here would create
// exactly the "two same-named hash twins" defect this programme keeps paying
// for (one seed-bearing / one seedless `generateGraphHash`; global CLAUDE.md
// trap 12 — derive, don't mirror). The unambiguous canonical NAME reserved for
// any shared implementation is `computeCanonicalGraphHash` (design §2.2); this
// module names the keep-list it must hash, not a rival digest.
//
// WHY A DOCUMENTED KEEP-LIST + A CLASSIFICATION TEST (not just a comment): the
// single-graph design's own keep-list was DEFECTIVE — it omitted
// `goal_constraints` (and options / goal_node_id), so a hard-constraint edit
// would NOT move the hash and the analysis would read FRESH after the user
// changed a constraint (S1 §D bottom / §F.1). The corrected floor below adopts
// CEE's analysis-affecting whitelist. The classification-completeness test
// (tests/boundary/s1-graph-hash.test.ts) DERIVES the graph-side field
// set from `GraphV3Schema` so a NEW graph field fails the build until it is
// consciously classified hashed-or-excluded — the drift never reads as green.
// ============================================================================

/**
 * Version of the nested analysis-affecting projection vocabulary.
 *
 * The digest implementation remains CEE's single
 * `computeAnalysisAffectingGraphHash`. Clients may use the manifest below
 * when reconciling receipts. Bump this integer whenever any nested inclusion
 * or conditional rule changes.
 *
 * ⚠ CORRECTED 0.61.0: this comment said "CEE imports the manifest below
 * rather than hand-maintaining its own key arrays". At CEE staging
 * `fc89aa301a3b846bd52997ce6f233fbe08f160c6` it does NOT:
 * `src/orchestrator-v5/context/graph-hash.ts` has zero `@talchain/schemas`
 * imports and hand-lists its node keys in `projectNode` (~:280-293) — a list
 * that already carries `nonlinear_identity`, which this vocabulary does not.
 * So re-vendoring this package moves NO hash by itself; CEE's hand list has
 * to change in the same pin wave.
 *
 * 2 (0.61.0, R1 S2): node `goal_threshold_frame`, `goal_direction` and
 * `quantity_frame` join the node vocabulary (see the list below).
 *
 * 3 (0.62.0, Shared Data row 1 — Canonical #72 5881225605, meaning AIQ 5881277231): `observed_state.source` joins
 * `observed_state_fields`. WHOSE a value is decides the science: ISL derives the base/level owner from this literal
 * and CEE's per-limit verdict reads `level_olumi_estimate` from it. Live on served CEE f79119b the same 3.2% moving
 * cee_inference → user_override left the hash unchanged, so a Run whose verdict was `estimate_only` stayed CURRENT
 * while a rerun gave `scored`. The literal is hashed as stored (fail closed: a move between two user-class literals
 * over-stales once, never under-stales). `reviewed_by_user` is deliberately NOT a hash input: a review changes no
 * analysis meaning (R11). ⚠ ONE-TIME MOVE: every stored graph with a stamped `source` rehashes, so each existing
 * analysis reads STALE once — ride the same CEE re-vendor as version 2 so the hash moves once.
 *   The same version also adds `observed_state.unit`, `observed_state.raw_value` and node `scale_frame` (AIQ #72
 *   5881494849, CODE-READ at CEE e25d0aa): CEE's run path reads all three to build the PLoT wire —
 *   `level-limit-baseline.ts` `statedUnitAcrossPeriod` picks a relabelled `%` limit's wire unit from the node's `unit`,
 *   and `targetScaleOf` feeds `unit` / `raw_value` / `scale_frame` into `percentLimitFrameProvable` (framed vs withheld).
 *   So they are not display twins: an edit to any of them changed the Run under the same hash. `scale_frame` is
 *   undeclared on `NodeV3Schema` and rides `.passthrough()`, like `goal_direction`. `extractionType`, `elicited_from`
 *   and `reviewed_by_user` stay out (no analysis reader).
 *   Also in version 3, the remaining compute inputs named by the Shared Data closure (#72 5881225605, row 1):
 *   `observed_state.std` (a stated spread: PLoT honours it first, unfloored, and ISL reads it), node
 *   `analysis_participation` (`retained_excluded` removes the node and its edges from the run) and node
 *   `nonlinear_identity` (the C46 carrier CEE ALREADY hashes, so listing it moves no hash — it closes the gap the 0.61.0
 *   correction above names). With these the vocabulary is CEE's whole stored-field projection, so CEE can import it
 *   instead of hand-listing. Both node fields ride `.passthrough()`.
 *   And the edge's `provenance.source`, `provenance.magnitude` and `provenance.natural_effect.amount_unit` (AIQ #72
 *   5881815357): the placeholder-parts predicate (DL 5881593118) withholds a limit moved only through placeholder links
 *   and tells them apart by these keys (`source: 'user_specified'` wins over `magnitude` at read time). Listed now so
 *   that predicate does not force a version 4 and a second one-time stale.
 *
 * 4 (0.64.0, proposed-option participation — Canonical #72 5887528088, DL 5887534233, marker MG 5887738387): node
 * `proposed_by` joins `fields`. Construction writes `proposed_by: 'olumi'` on an option node Olumi added (never `'user'`;
 * absent otherwise), and the Run's post-gate filter keeps such an option out of the ordinary comparison — so WHICH options
 * are compared depends on it. MEASURED with CEE's `computeAnalysisAffectingGraphHash` at staging 0497e52e: an
 * authorship-only change to an option (provenance + origin, node and option) left the hash unchanged, so an approved
 * "add to comparison" would have left the Run that excluded the option reading CURRENT. Hashed as stored. ⚠ NO MASS
 * STALE: the field is absent on every graph with no Olumi-proposed option, and absent fields are not projected, so those
 * graphs keep their exact hash; only a graph carrying the marker moves, once.
 *
 * 5 (0.66.0, TEMPORAL S2 — #75 5914193872; engine: ISL #216, PLoT #424): intervention `range` joins
 * `intervention.fields`. An option's stated range for a value it sets ({low, high, meaning}, raw units) now decides
 * that option's chance of meeting a limit on that value, so editing "5–20 days" to "5–30 days" must move the revision;
 * otherwise the old chance reads as CURRENT. Hashed as stored, on the intervention it qualifies. ⚠ NO MASS STALE: the
 * field is absent on every intervention without a stated range, and absent fields are not projected, so only a graph
 * carrying a range moves, once.
 *
 * 6 (0.82.0, event_risk.v1 — Science 393023 pilot §4): node `event_risk` joins `node.fields`. A risk's stated
 * occurrence range, horizon and mitigations decide every option's goal chance and downside, so editing "5–15%" to
 * "10–30%" must move the revision; otherwise the old chance reads as CURRENT. Hashed as stored. ⚠ NO MASS STALE:
 * the field is absent on every node that does not carry it, and absent fields are not projected, so only a graph
 * carrying an event risk moves, once.

 *   · `quantity_frame`       — what the node's value measures.
 * A limit's `value_frame` needs no entry: `goal_constraints` is hashed WHOLE
 * (`CANONICAL_GRAPH_HASH_ANALYSIS_STATE_FIELDS`).
 * ⚠ ONE-TIME MOVE: once CEE hashes these, every stored graph whose goal node
 * carries `goal_threshold_frame` (every agent-built graph with a goal target)
 * or a held `goal_direction` gets a new hash, so its existing analysis reads
