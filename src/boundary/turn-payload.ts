// notification whose singular target is only a representative. It cannot

// expected-before guard; extending it would let an older reader silently strip
// the new safety fields and still write. This strict event makes the mutation
// and its stale-base guard one versioned contract.
//
// AUTHORITY. The client carries intent, never a graph, provenance, std, source,
// operator, or trusted signed mean. CEE must resolve the unique `(from, to)` in
// its persisted GraphV3, compare `expected` exactly, derive the signed target
// from `magnitude` + `direction_intent`, and route the accepted write through
// the canonical `adjust_edge_strength` writer. `preserve` always means the
// direction on that persisted edge — never a client-side guess.
//
// CONFIRMATION. `confirm_current` is a provenance-only act: it requires
// `direction_intent: 'preserve'` and the exact current magnitude
// `abs(expected.mean)`. After verification, the existing canonical writer's
// provenance semantics apply (`provenance.source: 'user_specified'`,
// `provenance_display: 'user_set'`); mean, direction and std must not change,
// and analysis must not stale when the canonical hash is unchanged. The root
// refinement below makes contradictory payloads invalid before dispatch.

// ZERO IS DELIBERATE. `expected.effect_direction` remains required when mean is
// zero, and explicit positive/negative direction intents remain legal at zero.
// Direction cannot be recovered from the sign of zero; dropping this field or
// forcing zero positive would erase a live negative direction. The deployed
// canonical handler currently derives zero as positive, so the later CEE writer
// train must extend that handler with an explicit direction policy; invoking it

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// `structural_delete` (0.48.0) — a durable, atomic REMOVAL.
//
// THE DEFECT IT CLOSES. A user deletes an option on the canvas and it returns on
// the next rerun, because no UI→CEE vocabulary has ever been able to say
// "removed". All three closed vocabularies carry add/edit verbs only:
// `SystemEventKind` had 12 members whose structural pair is `factor_value_edit` /
// `edge_strength_edit`; `ActionType` has `set_factor_value`, `add_constraint`,
// `adjust_edge_strength`; `Intent` has `add_option`. The deletion never reached
// the server, so the server's model never lost the node — the canvas and the
// persisted model simply disagreed until the next read overwrote the canvas.
//
// WHY NOT REUSE `direct_graph_edit` — THE CONTRACT HAS ALREADY RULED. Its own
// comment above declares it a BATCH NOTIFICATION whose `target_id` is a
// "REPRESENTATIVE SINGULAR ... explicit target → else the first changed node id
// (ascending)", and `factor_value_edit`'s comment states the consequence
// verbatim: "Keying a MUTATION on a representative id would mutate whichever
// node happened to sort first in a batch rather than the one the user edited: a
// defect by construction." A delete is the most destructive mutation in the
// product; keying it on a representative id would delete the wrong node. The
// contract's established answer, now applied a third time: a mutating edit gets
// its OWN member, and `direct_graph_edit` keeps its notification semantics
// byte-identically.
//
// WHY PLURAL AND ATOMIC — the one property that must not be "simplified" away.
// Unlike `factor_value_edit`/`edge_strength_edit`, which address exactly one
// entity, a canvas delete is INHERENTLY a batch: removing a node necessarily
// removes its incident edges. Applying such a removal partially leaves DANGLING
// EDGES — edges whose endpoint no longer exists — which is a graph that violates
// referential integrity and will fail or silently mis-analyse downstream. So the
// arrays are plural, and the whole event is ONE transaction: CEE applies all of
// it or none of it. Splitting this into a singular member (or fanning it out into
// N single-delete turns) reintroduces the dangling-edge window by construction.
//
// REMOVAL ONLY — ADD IS DELIBERATELY EXCLUDED. `Intent.add_option` already owns
// adding, and it works: the add persists today. A combined "structural_edit"
// covering both directions would create TWO AUTHORITIES for one concept, which is
// the defect class this estate pays for most often. The adjacent readiness
// problem ("an added option leaves the model unanalysable") is a different seam
// from transport and is not fixed by widening this member.
//
// EDGES ARE ADDRESSED BY `(from, to)`, NEVER BY AN ID — derived, not chosen.
// `EdgeV3Schema` (src/graph.ts) declares NO `id` field at all; an edge's only
// identity in the canonical graph is its endpoint pair. Both existing
// edge-addressed members say so explicitly: `edge_adjudication` notes client-side
// ids ("reactflow__edge-…") "are NOT stable across repos ... never the lookup
// key", and `edge_strength_edit` addresses edges by canonical `(from, to)`. A
// `removed_edge_ids: string[]` field would therefore be unresolvable against the
// persisted graph and could only carry a client-local id the contract forbids as
// a key — so the wire refuses that shape outright.
//
// `base_graph_hash` IS THE STALE GATE, and the name is the estate's existing one:
// `EditToolOpBatchSchema.base_graph_hash` (src/orchestrator/edit-tool-ops.ts),
// whose divergence code is `BASE_HASH_DIVERGED` and whose rule is quoted here
// because it applies unchanged — "Absent/null/empty are all forbidden: the stale
// gate is non-optional". A delete is unsafe to apply against a graph the user was
// not looking at: ids drift, and a stale delete removes something the user never
// selected. CEE MUST compare this against its own canonical hash and refuse on
// mismatch rather than applying a best-effort subset.
//
// ⚠ AND THE ONE DIFFERENCE FROM THAT PRECEDENT, stated so it is not "corrected":
// there the hash is STAMPED SERVER-SIDE because the producer is the LLM, and A5b
// reasons that "the model never echoes a hash" (a transcription error would
// produce spurious dead-ends). That argument does NOT transfer here, because the
// producer is the BROWSER, which genuinely holds the graph it rendered. A client
// echoing state it actually read is the established optimistic-concurrency idiom
// of this very union — `edge_strength_edit.expected` is "an optimistic-concurrency
// assertion, not the requested value". Client-echoed here is correct; server-
// stamped there is correct; they are different producers, not an inconsistency.
//
// DELIBERATELY UNCAPPED. `selected_elements` is bounded (≤20) because it is
// advisory piggyback context. This is not: select-all-then-delete is a legitimate
// user action, and a cap would refuse a request the server can honour perfectly
// well — an affordance terminating in refusal. Bound it only if a real DoS
// measurement demands it, and then bound it where the measurement points.
//
// NO `cascade` FLAG, and no server-side inference of extra removals. The client
// enumerates exactly what the user removed. A `cascade: true` would let one flag
// mean "also delete things I have not named", which is a mutation whose extent
// the user never saw and the wire cannot audit.
//
// ⚠ SEQUENCING — READER-FIRST IS MANDATORY, NOT A PREFERENCE. Every member of
// this union is `.strict()` and the union is a `discriminatedUnion` on `kind`, so
// a consumer pinned ≤0.47.0 that receives this member fails the DISCRIMINATOR and
// REJECTS THE WHOLE TURN (422) — not just this field. Order: publish 0.48.0 → CEE
// re-vendors + deploys a reader → only then the UI emitter ships. UI-alone would
// 422 every turn containing a delete; CEE-alone is invisible and safe. Pinned by
// `tests/boundary/turn-payload-0.48.test.ts`.
//
// AUTHORITY STAYS SERVER-SIDE. The client carries intent and the base hash only —
// never a graph, never a receipt, never a count it expects to be true afterwards.
// CEE resolves each id in its persisted GraphV3 and routes the accepted removal
// through the canonical `remove_node` / `remove_edge` PatchOperation train
// (`handleEditGraph` → `evaluateEditGraphMutations` → commit) that the coach edit
// tool already uses. This member is a TRANSPORT for a human's removal; it does
// not mint a second applier.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// `base_graph_hash` — ONE schema, shared by every structural member.
//
// DERIVED, NOT CHOSEN. Both pre-existing sites of this field name validate it
// as exactly `z.string().min(1)`: `StructuralDeleteEvent.base_graph_hash`
// (0.48.0, below) and `EditToolOpBatchSchema.base_graph_hash`
// (src/orchestrator/edit-tool-ops.ts). The 0.50.0 structural members bind to
// this same constant rather than restating the validator, so the four members
// cannot drift into two spellings of one concept — the hand-maintained-mirror
// defect this repo pays for most often. Parity is pinned by execution in
// tests/boundary/turn-payload-0.50.test.ts, not asserted in prose.
//
// ⚠ WHY THERE IS DELIBERATELY NO HEX REGEX HERE, stated so it is not "tightened"
// later by someone who assumes the omission is an oversight. The value CEE
// compares against is the ANALYSIS-AFFECTING hash — `computeAnalysisAffectingGraphHash`
// (CEE `src/orchestrator-v5/context/graph-hash.ts`), which is SHA-256 truncated
// to a 16-char hex prefix (`HASH_HEX_LENGTH = 16`, `.digest('hex').slice(0, 16)`),
// and is the only graph hash CEE ever puts on the wire. The 64-hex IDENTITY hash
// (`computeGraphIdentityHash`) has NO wire emitter and is used only for the
// server-derived atomic RPC CAS. Binding this field to the 64-hex shape would
// yield a gate that can never match — an affordance terminating in refusal.
// A width regex is nonetheless NOT added, for two reasons: (a) neither existing
// site has one, and introducing one here would make the same field name mean two
// different validations inside one union; (b) the width is a CEE implementation
// constant, and pinning it in the published contract would turn a truncation-length
// change into a cross-repo breaking change. The contract states the semantics; CEE
// remains the authority on the digest.

// a node — still had no wire shape, so each was either lost on the next reload

// by construction". These three members follow the pattern 0.48.0 established
// and re-state none of it: intent plus a `base_graph_hash` assertion, resolved
// against the server's own persisted read. Authority stays server-side.
//
// ⚠⚠ THE APPARENT CONTRADICTION WITH 0.48.0, RESOLVED RATHER THAN OVERRULED.
// `structural_delete`'s comment says, in terms, "REMOVAL ONLY — ADD IS
// DELIBERATELY EXCLUDED. `Intent.add_option` already owns adding". That sentence
// is still TRUE and is not being reversed here, because it is about a DIFFERENT
// CONCEPT wearing a similar name. Derived at the bytes (enums.ts:124-149):
// `Intent` is the authored COACHING / ELICITATION vocabulary, "DECOUPLED from
// ActionType", and its `add_option` member is "add a decision OPTION (the
// compound-transaction intent; the referee `add_option` case wires to a LIVE
// producer through this)". It adds a decision option through the coaching
// referee. `structural_add` creates a GRAPH NODE from a direct canvas gesture,
// with no LLM and no referee, and cannot express "add a decision option" at all.
// Two authorities for one concept is the defect class this estate pays for most
// often (global CLAUDE.md trap 21 — two questions under similar names); the fix
// there is to NAME THE CONCEPTS APART, which is what this paragraph does. If a
// future lane wants to fold them, that is a product decision with a referee
// seam attached, not a contract tidy-up.
//
// WHY THREE MEMBERS AND NOT ONE `structural_edit`. Same ruling as 0.48.0, applied
// a fourth time: each verb carries a different payload and a different failure
// mode, and a single member would need a nested discriminator to keep them apart
// — which is the union we already have, one level down and harder to read. The
// union is the discriminator.
//
// ⚠ SEQUENCING IS UNCHANGED AND STILL MANDATORY. Every member of this union is
// `.strict()` and the union is a `discriminatedUnion` on `kind`, so a consumer
// pinned below 0.50.0 that receives one of these fails the DISCRIMINATOR and
// REJECTS THE WHOLE TURN (422) — not just this field. Order: publish 0.50.0 →
// CEE re-vendors and deploys a reader → only then the UI emitter ships.
// UI-alone would 422 every turn carrying a direct edit; CEE-alone is invisible
// and safe.
//
// ⚠ THE ID-SPACE ASYMMETRY IS DERIVED AND DELIBERATE — do not "make it
// consistent". `structural_add` mints a NEW node id and therefore validates it
// against `NodeV3Schema.shape.id` (which carries `NODE_ID_PATTERN`), because an
// id that fails that pattern is one CEE cannot persist into GraphV3 — the
// producer's own declared semantics. `structural_rename` and
// `structural_add_edge` address EXISTING nodes and therefore use
// `CanonicalEdgeEndpointIdSchema`, whose comment states the reason verbatim:
// "CEE's persisted GraphV3 is the authority and its deployed node ids are open
// strings, so do not narrow this to the root package's lowercase NodeV3 id
// regex." Narrowing the existing-id fields would refuse live nodes; loosening
// the new-id field would mint unpersistable ones. Both directions are wrong.

/**
 * `structural_add` (0.50.0) — create ONE node from a direct canvas gesture.

 * SINGULAR, unlike `structural_delete`. The plurality there is forced: removing a
 * node necessarily removes its incident edges, so a partial application leaves
 * DANGLING EDGES. Creating a node has no such cascade — a new node has no
 * incident edges by construction — so there is no atomicity argument for a batch,

 * `option_intervention_edit` — the Model tab's per-cell option→factor effect
 * value, addressed by canonical node ids.
 *
 * ── WHY A NEW MEMBER, AND WHY NOT ONE OF THE FOUR EXISTING SHAPES ──────────
 * The reasoning is `edge_strength_edit`'s, unchanged, because the two
 * objections it recorded apply here word for word: `direct_graph_edit` is
 * deliberately a value-less BATCH notification whose singular `target_id` is a
 * REPRESENTATIVE, so it cannot truthfully carry an authoritative mutation; and
 * `chip_click`'s parameter bag is intentionally open with no expected-before
 * guard, so extending it would let an older reader strip the safety field and
 * still write.
 *
 * ⚠ AND IT IS NOT `factor_value_edit`. That member moves a FACTOR's own
 * `observed_state.value` — what the factor is. This one moves what ONE OPTION
 * would make that factor become, which is a different entity living at
 * `/nodes/<option>/data/interventions/<factor>`. Collapsing them would put two
 * questions under one name, and the wrong-entity write that confusion produces
 * is already witnessed: a user answering an option-effect question had a factor
 * BASELINE written instead, the interventions stayed `0`, and the blocker
 * survived by identity.
 *
 * ── IDENTITY IS CARRIED, NEVER RE-DERIVED ─────────────────────────────────
 * Both ids are canonical and exact. The server already has a deterministic
 * label-matching resolver for this same write, reached from chat, and its own
 * header records why that cannot serve a direct-manipulation surface: real
 * drafted option labels are the user's brief fragments (84–101 characters on
 * the captured graph), every user-facing rendering truncates them, and the
 * truncated sentence resolves to "option not named" while a plausible-looking
 * write lands on the wrong entity. A surface that HOLDS the ids must send the
 * ids.
 *
 * ── WHAT IS DELIBERATELY ABSENT ───────────────────────────────────────────
 * No `unit`, no `raw_value`, no provenance, no actor. The canonical operation
 * builder for this cell emits `value` alone and states why: populating the
 * user-scale trio means choosing a scale conversion nothing here has a basis
 * for. A wire field nothing may honestly populate is a field a later reader
 * will populate anyway.
 *
 * ── SEQUENCING, WHICH IS LOAD-BEARING ─────────────────────────────────────
 * Every `SystemEventSchema` member is `.strict()` and the union discriminates
 * on `kind`, so a consumer pinned below the release carrying this member
 * rejects the WHOLE turn (422), not just this field. Reader before emitter,
 * and the client affordance last of all — the same order `structural_delete`
 * and the 0.50.0 direct-edit vocabulary took.

//
// ⭐ THE AUTHORISATION, RECORDED HERE SO A LATER READER FINDS IT RATHER THAN AN
// UNEXPLAINED FREE-TEXT FIELD. CEE carries a standing privacy ruling, R-004
// (`olumi-assistants-service` src/orchestrator-v5/system-events/dispatch.ts:396),
// quoted verbatim rather than paraphrased away:
//
//   "the fact records `comment_present`, NEVER the comment text — the user's
//    free text may contain PII and a fact row is long-lived and widely read.
//    The contract's `FeedbackResultSchema` is `.strict()`, so a future
//    `comment` field is a deliberate reviewed widening, not a quiet leak."
//
// PAUL SLEE RULED ON 2026-09-11 THAT A USER'S STATED REASONING MAY BE
// PERSISTED. This member IS the deliberate reviewed widening R-004 anticipated,
// taken on the axis R-004 named. R-004 is NOT reversed and still governs
// `feedback`: that member's `comment` stays a rating aside whose fact row
// records presence only. What changes is that a stated REASON — text a user
// wrote in order to be read by their team — now has a carrier of its own, where
// persisting the words is the entire point rather than a side effect.
//
// WHAT IT CLOSES. On the Reasoning tab a user can disagree with a finding and
// type why; that text terminates in the browser (`commitDispute` →
// `recordDissent` → `localStorage.setItem`) and never leaves it. Olumi is a
// living shared model of the team's REASONING with humans as the authors, and
// the one thing that could not reach the shared model was a human's stated
// reason. Derived across the union before minting this: `edge_adjudication` is a
// structured verdict with NO WORDS, and `feedback` is words the fact row
// deliberately DISCARDS. Neither is a place for a stated reason to land.
//
// ⚠⚠ THE NAME, AND WHAT IT IS NOT — trap 21, and this estate has paid for it.
// The union's naming convention is `<subject>_<act>`, and the closest sibling is
// `edge_adjudication`: a human's judgement about a named server-produced
// artefact, named subject-then-act-noun. `finding_dissent` takes that shape
// exactly. Both halves were swept for collision before use.
//   · NOT `disagreement_*`, and the ban is not stylistic. `DisagreementSchema`
//     (boundary/collab.ts) is a SERVER-DERIVED artefact of a facilitation round
//     — a composed contest object with typed parties, a status lifecycle and its
//     own persistence — and CEE separately runs a `disagreement_resolution`
//     LENS over `edge.validation.status === 'contested'`, which is the MACHINE
//     disagreeing with ITSELF across two validation passes. Three different
//     concepts. Sharing a name would make them look like one thing to
//     reconcile, and reconciling them is the wrong move.
//   · NOT `*_contest`/`*_contested` either: `contested` is already bound
//     estate-wide to the ContestedEdgeCard seam that `edge_adjudication` serves.
//   · NOT `DisagreementPosition.doubt`, which collab.ts calls "VALUELESS
//     dissent" — a position kind that declares no other member, so a value
//     smuggled onto it fails to parse BY CONSTRUCTION. This member is its exact
//     complement: dissent WITH the words. The wire carries no bridge between
//     them, and a lane that later wants one must design it rather than assume
//     the shared English word already means it.
//   · NOT A GRAPH MUTATION. Every `*_edit` and `structural_*` member writes the
//     model. This one writes nothing but a record of what a human said, which is
//     why its name carries no edit verb — see the `base_graph_hash` note below.
//
// IDENTITY IS BOTH IDS, AND `analysis_id` IS NOT CONTEXT — IT IS THE OTHER HALF.
// The Reasoning tab addresses a finding by a per-run recommendation id, which
// may not survive the next analysis. So the id ALONE is a dangling reference the
// moment the model is rerun, and a dissent shown beside a later analysis would
// be a claim the user never made. The pair (run, finding) is the address; that
// is why `analysis_id` is REQUIRED rather than optional context, and why the
// absence-vs-empty question never arises for it.
//
// NO `base_graph_hash`, AND THE OMISSION IS THE POINT. Five members carry that
// field as a STALE GATE whose rule is "CEE MUST refuse on divergence". Applying
// it here would refuse a TRUE STATEMENT OF WHAT A HUMAN SAID because the graph
// had moved underneath it — destroying the record this member exists to keep.
// A dissent is not a mutation and has no base to be stale against. Putting the
// same field name on two different questions is precisely the defect
// `CanonicalBaseGraphHashSchema`'s own comment refuses ("the same field name
// mean two different validations inside one union").
//
// NO `authored_by` / `provenance`, following `edge_adjudication` verbatim: "the
// event KIND is the provenance claim (only a user acts on this surface). A
// client-supplied constant would add nothing the server could trust." CEE stamps
// them server-side. The `.strict()` reject of both keys is pinned in
// turn-payload-0.55.test.ts.
//
// NO COPY OF THE FINDING'S OWN TEXT, and this is a deliberate refusal rather
// than an oversight. It is tempting — a dissent whose subject no longer resolves
// is illegible. But the finding's words are CEE's own output, which CEE can
// resolve from `(analysis_id, finding_id)` without being told; a client-echoed
// copy would be a second free-text surface, a second thing a client could
// fabricate, and "a wire field nothing may honestly populate is a field a later
// reader will populate anyway". The asymmetry decides it: adding the field later
// is ADDITIVE, removing it is BREAKING. If CEE derives that it cannot resolve a
// finding id against a stored run, that is a finding to report and an additive
// follow-up — not a field to mint speculatively now.
//
// NO SUBJECT-KIND VOCABULARY. One subject class emits today. Pre-registering
// kinds nobody emits is the exact non-adoption failure the population registry
// records as its own anti-pattern: an id enters in the same change train as the
// producer that emits it.
//
// ⚠ SEQUENCING — READER-FIRST IS MANDATORY, NOT A PREFERENCE. Every member of
// this union is `.strict()` and the union is a `discriminatedUnion` on `kind`,
// so a consumer pinned ≤0.54.0 that receives this member fails the DISCRIMINATOR
// and REJECTS THE WHOLE TURN (422) — not just this field. Order: publish 0.55.0
// → CEE re-vendors and deploys a reader → only then the UI emitter ships.
// UI-alone would 422 every turn carrying a dissent; CEE-alone is invisible and
// safe.
