// ============================================================================
// 0.39.0 car 4 (ROADMAP 2.686 U-S0 / 2.968 build-list item 1) — the
// collaborative-elicitation + disagreement contract types.
//
// Designs of record (workspace root): COLLAB-UNIFIED-BUILD-PLAN-2026-08-07
// (§1 Verdict 2 — the composed disagreement object; §3 U-S0 item 6 — this
// schemas minor) and COLLAB-ELICITATION-DESIGN-2026-08-07 (G2 §4 storage
// shapes, §6 disagreement object). Scope is the 2.968 build-list item 1
// MINIMUM: `ElicitationRound` / `ElicitationEvent` / `Disagreement` /
// `DisagreementType` + the position-kind union (census kinds + `doubt`) +
// the `authored_by` vocabulary (co-designed with 2.682 — ONE axis).
//
// RATIFIED RULINGS (Paul, 8 Aug — the 3-ruling package) ENCODED AS PARSE
// RULES, not prose:
//   - Verdict 2 (composed typing): the WHY axis (`DisagreementType`) is
//     orthogonal to the position vocabulary (Gen-1 census kinds
//     exists/absent/reversed + attributed value + preference + `doubt`).
//   - `doubt` is FIRST-CLASS and VALUELESS: its union arm declares NO other
//     field, so dissent-with-a-smuggled-value FAILS TO PARSE (the
//     analysis-fact doctrine — a withheld value carrying a number is an
//     unrecognized key).
//   - Spread-not-consensus / preserve difference: NO aggregate, combined,
//     recommended or winner member exists ANYWHERE in this family, every
//     object is `.strict()`, so one smuggled in fails to parse. The
//     aggregation seam (`internal_combined`) is GATED-ABSENT pre-Neil and
//     deliberately NOT DECLARED — declaring it would let a producer populate
//     an unruled semantics and still validate.
//   - Blindness is a SERVER property (the packet response simply does not
//     contain sibling answers/model values/aggregates/counts). The
//     packet/reveal RESPONSE shapes are CEE route shapes and ride the CEE
//     slice's train, NOT this car (the 2.968 build-list item 1 names types
//     only; the unified plan's U-S0 item 6 listed response shapes too — the
//     narrower later list is taken, flagged in the CHANGELOG).
//
// NEIL-GATE STRUCTURAL OMISSION: `elicited_range` (G2 §4.1 names it
// "reserved-but-unpopulated pre-Neil") is NOT DECLARED on
// `ElicitationBeliefSchema`. With a `.strict()` parent, populating it before
// the interval-semantics ruling FAILS TO PARSE — the gate lives in the type
// system instead of producer discipline. It lands additively in a minor when
// the ruling does.

 * story. Absent means "this apply cited no evidence", which is every apply
 * written before 0.41.0 and every ordinary one after it. Absence NEVER means

 * the journey-witnessed apply path is unchanged when nothing cites anything.
