// Health manifest (arch step 2, S0) — CONTRACT-INTENT-FACTS-DESIGN-2026-07-26 §"Adoption order".
//
// The four fields EVERY Olumi service must expose at the TOP LEVEL of its health
// response, so that "which contract is this box actually running?" is answerable
// from outside the box, before a wire mismatch shows up as a wrong number.
//
// Deliberately NOT nested under a `contract` key: a nested object is easy to add
// and easy for a load balancer / smoke test to never look at. Top-level fields
// sit next to `build` and get read.
//
// The four fields:
//
//   schema_write_version   Exact @talchain/schemas version this service WRITES its
//                          responses against. One value. Not a range.
//
//   schema_read_versions   Every @talchain/schemas version this service is prepared
//                          to READ from a peer. At least one entry, normally
//                          including schema_write_version. This is the field that
//                          makes reader-first deploy ordering verifiable: a writer
//                          may only be promoted once every downstream reader already
//                          lists its release line here.
//
//   schema_sha             SHA-256 of the contract bytes the service was BUILT
//                          against — `SCHEMA_SHA` exported from this package (see
//                          ./generated-constants.ts). Catches the case two services
//                          report the same version string but were built against
//                          different bytes (re-published tag, stale vendored copy).
//
//   contract_manifest_sha  SHA-256 of contracts/adoption-manifest.json — `CONTRACT_MANIFEST_SHA`
//                          exported from this package. Two services reporting different
//                          values are governed by different adoption rules, which is
//                          how a field silently slips back into an un-tracked state.
//
// RELEASE LINE: `@talchain/schemas` is 0.x, so per semver-caret the breaking axis is
// MINOR, not MAJOR. `releaseLine('0.24.1') === '0.24'`; `releaseLine('1.2.3') === '1'`.
// Compatibility is judged on release lines, never on exact versions.
