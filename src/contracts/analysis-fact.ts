// ============================================================================
// AnalysisFact — the subject-scoped, status-discriminated analysis fact.
// Arch step 2, contract slice 4. Codex contract step-2 finding F3 (P1).
//
// THE DEFECT THIS MAKES UNREPRESENTABLE. The shape this replaces is a flat
// `status` field beside a separate option-keyed value map
// (`RunAnalysisResult.win_probabilities: Record<string, number>`). Under that
// shape, `status: 'suppressed'` and a still-present plausible number in the map
// BOTH parse — nothing in the type system relates the two, so a guard can
// withhold a metric in one field while the number it withheld rides the wire in
// another. A consumer then reads the number and states it. That is the estate's
// #1 defect class, and no amount of producer discipline can close it, because
// the contract cannot see it.
//
// A discriminated union can. `ComputedFact` REQUIRES `value`; `UnavailableFact`
// and `SuppressedFact` DO NOT DECLARE `value` AT ALL, and every branch is
// `.strict()`, so a suppressed fact carrying a number is an unrecognized key and
// FAILS TO PARSE. The mutual exclusion is the whole point of the shape: it is
// not a convention a producer must remember, it is a parse error.
// `tests/contracts/analysis-fact.test.ts` keeps a reconstruction of the flat
// shape checked in permanently as the BLIND CONTROL and asserts, case by case,
// that the flat shape ACCEPTS every negative this union REJECTS.
//
// SUBJECT-SCOPING IS PART OF THE FIX, NOT AN EXTRA. One fact per
// metric-per-subject (`win_probability` on `option_a`), never a map keyed by
// option id — because a map cannot carry per-metric status, units, method or
// population, which is exactly why the flat shape needed a second field in the
// first place. `CONTRACT-STEP2-DESIGN-2026-07-26.md` described `fact_id` as a
// "stable id for THIS metric-on-this-subject" while declaring no subject member
// anywhere on the shape; that omission is closed here (`subject` is REQUIRED on
// every branch) rather than inherited.
//
// FACT IDENTITY IS PRODUCER-OWNED AND MINTED BEFORE COMMIT — it is NOT the
// database row id, and it cannot be. Verified at the bytes in CEE
// (`820f3e83`): `supabase-store.ts:565`'s select list is
// `'payload, handler_id, action_type, noop, v5_conversation_turn_id, created_at'`,
// so `v5_handler_facts.id` never leaves the store; `append_turn_atomic` returns
// the TURN row id, not fact ids; claims are composed before any of those ids
// exist; and ONE handler row carries MANY metrics, so a row id could not
// address a metric even if it were readable. `storage_fact_row_id` is a
// SEPARATE, optional slot for the storage id when a store ever surfaces it —
// deliberately a different member, so the two identities can never be conflated
// by a producer that happens to have one of them to hand.
//
// PLACEMENT (deliberate, and the reason this slice is safe to ship alone).
// Additive and OPTIONAL, CEE-internal only: `RunAnalysisResult.analysis_facts?`.
// `RunAnalysisResultSchema` is `.strict()` but never crosses the UI wire (it is
// an `ORCHESTRATOR_INTERNAL` fixture-coverage exclusion — the persisted handler
// fact payload). NOTHING is removed: `win_probabilities` and every other legacy
// map is RETAINED for the compatibility window.
// When these facts do reach the UI wire, they go at a NEW TOP-LEVEL key on
// `OlumiResponseSchema` — measured at UI tip `6d3f4611`, `responseParser.ts`
// splits unknown TOP-LEVEL keys into a `__additive__` sidecar BEFORE strict
// validation (safe against an un-re-vendored 0.22.0 UI), whereas an unknown key
// inside an existing strict NESTED object is a `schema_mismatch` HARD FAIL.
// That is a different slice, with the UI re-vendor in its train.
